''' Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.
'''

# Upper Case
# The upper() method returns the string in upper case:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.upper())

# Lower Case
# The lower() method returns the string in lower case:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())

# Remove Whitespace
'''Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.'''
b = " Good, Morning! "
print(b.strip()) # returns "Good, Morning!"

# split() - output display in list
a = "Hello hi World!"
print(a.split())
