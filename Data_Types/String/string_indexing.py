# string indexing
'''Strings are ordered sequences of character data.
Indexing allows you to access individual characters in a string directly by using a numeric value.
String indexing is zero-based: the first character in the string has index 0, the next is 1, and so on.'''

# ex:
s1='Morning'
print(s1[5])
print(s1[-3])

# print a program of user input element of first and last letter
n1='luminar'
print(n1)
print('first letter',n1[0])
print('last letter',n1[-1])
